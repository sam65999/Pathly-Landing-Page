# Pathly-Landing-Page
This is my first ever landing page project, and I'm really proud of how it turned out! After developing the Pathly app, I realized I needed a professional website to showcase it to potential users. I decided to build a modern, responsive landing page that would highlight all the app's features and benefits.
